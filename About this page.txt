In this page I gathered portfolio materials of the projects I made in school with group of students.
This page doesn´t include all the things I´ve done but the ones that are worth of showing. :)

This page includes:
- Bank software poster & my part of coding (Pin code functionality)
- Unity game project poster
- Portable Game device project codes & Powerpoint materials

In the Unity game project I made mostly graphics so I didn´t include them to this website but other projects I have codes in it.
